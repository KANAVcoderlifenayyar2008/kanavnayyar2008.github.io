                                 and nations on Planet Earth. Different cultures, religions, philosophies, and organizations have varying concepts on how 
                                 such a state would come about.
                                Various religious and secular organizations have the stated aim of achieving world peace through addressing human rights, technology,
                                 education, engineering, medicine, or diplomacy used as an end to all forms of fighting.</p>

                            <p>Many Buddhists believe that world peace can only be achieved if individuals establish peace within their minds first.
                                 The Buddha's teachings emphasize that anger and other negative states of mind are the cause of wars and conflict.
                                  Buddhists believe people can live in peace and harmony only if they abandon negative emotions such as anger and cultivate 
                                  positive emotions such as loving-kindness and compassion.</p>

                            <p>Traditionally, Hinduism has adopted an ancient Sanskrit phrase Vasudhaiva kutumbakam,
                                 which translates as "The world is one family". The essence of this concept is the observation that only base minds see dichotomies
                                  and divisions. The more we seek wisdom, the more we become inclusive and free our internal spirit from worldly illusions or Maya.
                                   World peace is hence only achieved through internal means by liberating ourselves from artificial boundaries that separate us all.</p>

                            <p>The Sikh religion preaches that peace comes from God. However, pacifism is not absolute in Sikh religion, and Sikhs have taken military action against oppression.

                                Sikh people believe that meditation, the means of communicating with God, is unfruitful without the noble character of a devotee, as
                                 there can be no worship without performing good deeds.[34] Guru Nanak stressed now kirat karo: that a Sikh should balance work,
                                  worship, and charity, and should defend the rights of all creatures, and in particular, fellow human beings. They are encouraged to
                                   have a chaṛdī kalā, or optimistic – resilience, view of life. Sikh teachings also stress the concept of sharing—vaṇḍ chakko —through 
                                   the distribution of free food at Sikh gurdwaras (langar), giving charitable donations, and working for the good of the community and 
                                   others (sēvā). Sikhs believe that no matter what race, sex, or religion one is, all are equal in God's eyes. Men and women are equal 
                                   and share the same rights, and women can lead prayers.</p>

                            <p class="mb-0">The United Nations International Day of Peace, sometimes called World Peace Day, is observed annually on 21 September.
                                 It is dedicated to peace, and specifically the absence of war and violence, and can be celebrated by a temporary ceasefire in
                                  a combat zone. The International Day of Peace was established in 1981 by the United Nations General Assembly. 
                                  Two decades later, in 2001, the General Assembly unanimously voted to designate the day as a day of preventing violence 
                                  and a cease-fire. The celebration of this day is recognized by many nations and people. In 2013, for the first time, 
                                  the day has been dedicated to peace education, i.e. by the key preventive means to reduce war sustainably.</p>
